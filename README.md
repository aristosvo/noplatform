# No Platform

No platform is the best way to limit platform abstractions and platform fallacies. Provide nothing; DIY rules.

## Testimonials

Some reviews on the first version of the non-existing platform seems to be worth sharing:
- "We thought we had a neat service mesh implementation.., but it all fades compared to this non existent platform without any mesh. Thanks for putting on the challenge!"
- "The amount of YAML saved by this noplatform is out of this world!"
- "We invested the time we saved on building the platform into connecting with real people. The world became a better place."
- "We moved from to on-prem to the cloud into non-existence. Whats next, AI?"
- "Have you ever seen a question which cannot be answered with 'more Kubernetes'? 'How to implement noplatform' seems to be one of the few."

## Getting started

Start stopping seems to be the answer here.

## Contributing

We should've started with just publishing a static HTML file instead of using the GitHub platform. We failed desperately in this no platform effort, please be better.
